# Advent of Code 2023

Writing these in TS, for Bun

## Importing Task
To get the current days task (only in December)
```sh
bun import.ts
```
You can run this again without it overwriting your previous index.ts, but it will update the readme (usually helpful for part 2).

You can also write `bun import.ts <day>` to pull a specific day if you need to for some reason (e.g you missed a day)
```sh
bun import.ts 1 # downloads day 1
```

## Running

Nothing fancy, to run day 1 do:
```sh
bun days/01/index.ts
```
Extrapolate for other days
